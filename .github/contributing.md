# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to argonaut-codecs! This file is a short, sweet introduction to contributing to this project. We ask that all new contributors read it before their first contribution to make sure we can get your work merged.

## Getting Started

### Do I belong here?

Everyone is welcome! People of all experience levels can join, begin contributing, and feel comfortable and safe making mistakes. People of all backgrounds belong here so long as they treat others with dignity and respect and do not harass, belittle, or insult others.

### What is the correct way to ask a question?

Feel free to ask questions by [opening an issue](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs/issues)! You can also ask questions on the [PureScript Discourse](https://discourse.purescript.org), or on the [Functional Programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com) ([join](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com)!) in the `#purescript` and `#purescript-beginners` channels.

### I'd like to help, how do I pick something to work on?

Any [open issue](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs/issues) that is not assigned to anyone is good to work on! If it's your first time contributing it's probably best to pick an issue marked [good first issue](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue). You can also search for issues marked [help-wanted](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted).

The easiest way you can help is by contributing documentation (issues marked [document me](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22document+me). If you'd like to contribute documentation, we suggest [reading about the four kinds of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com).

Your contribution can be as small as copy-pasting some instructions from an issue into the documentation! Everything is welcome.

## Developing argonaut-codecs

All `purescript-contrib` libraries use recent versions of [PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript), [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago), and [psa](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-psa). Any additional development dependencies can be installed via NPM and are listed in the `package.json` file for the repository.

### Proposing changes

If you would like to contribute code, tests, or documentation, please feel free to open a pull request for small changes. For large changes we recommend you first open an issue to propose your change and ensure that the maintainers are on board before you spend time implementing the change. We want to respect your time and effort. We can also assign the issue to you if you would like to make sure you're the one to work on it.

### Merging changes

All changes must happen through a pull request. Everyone with commit access can merge changes, though by convention we like to wait for two approvals for non-trivial changes. All pull requests must pass continuous integration; if the change adds new code we may also ask that you add a test.

## How do I get the "commit bit"?

If you'd like to take part in maintaining argonaut-codecs, just ask! We hand out the commit bit to folks who display sustained interest in the project. You can ask directly (for example: on Slack or via a DM on Discourse) or by opening an issue -- whichever you prefer!
